<p>Western drugmakers were pretty head-over-heels about prospects in China until authorities launched a bribery probe against GlaxoSmithKline which dragged on for a year and ended with a half billion dollar fine and people going to jail. That has left drugmakers to rethink their strategies there and for Bristol-Myers Squibb &nbsp;it means cutting hundreds off its payroll.&nbsp;Chinese media said most of the cuts are sales reps. A BMS spokesperson in an email today declined to give specific numbers or details of the cuts. <a href="http://www.fiercepharma.com/story/bms-makes-cuts-china-reports-say-1000/2014-12-02"><strong>Read more</strong></a> |&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.fiercepharma.com/offer/signup">Subscribe to&nbsp;<em>FiercePharma</em></a></strong></p>
